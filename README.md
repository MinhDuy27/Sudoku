This program attempts to solve an 9x9 sized square sudoku using beta-hill climbing algorithm. This algorithm has been described in this link: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319886025_b-Hill_Climbing_Algorithm_for_Sudoku_Game
\
 B_algorithm and N_algorithm was modified to tailor with my work, that different with the one that use in above article.\
SudokuSolve.py store all the logic of the program, sudokuGUI.py explain how the UI display when start this program.

Above picture describe the beta-hill_climbing in the most abstraction way. Remember that each algorithms is suitable for a number of sudoku board and never make sure that beta-hill_climbing can solve all the sudoku board that we can meet.
